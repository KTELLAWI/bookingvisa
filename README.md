### Step 1: Create Your Apollo.io Account

- **Account Type**: Register for a business account on Apollo.io.
- **Benefits**: Enjoy up to 10,000 free email verifications each month.
- **Email Requirement**: Use a business email for registration (domains other than generic ones like Gmail or Yahoo).

### Step 2: Build Your Leads List

- **List Creation**: Compile a list of leads within Apollo.io.
- **Note on Scrapping Limitation**: Due to recent security updates, direct scraping is limited. Lists are used for enriching and exposing emails.
- **Maximum List Size**: Ensure your list does not exceed 2,500 leads, as this is the maximum viewable amount on Apollo.io.

- **Tip**: Select "Verified Emails" during list creation to ensure inclusion of contacts with verified email addresses.
- **Tip**: Use multiple accounts to make multiple lead lists per day. Apollo.io can temporarily ban you for adding more than 2k leads a day so be careful.

### Step 3: Operate the Scraper

- **Credentials Input**: Enter your Apollo.io account email and encrypted password into the Apify scraper.
- **Security**: The encryption ensures your password remains secure and inaccessible.
- **List URL**: Input the URL of the list created in Step 2.
- **Scraper Execution**: Click 'Start' to begin scraping.
- **Processing Time**: It takes approximately 10 minutes to scrape every 500 contacts.
- **Export**: Once completed, you can export your list of leads from the scraper.
